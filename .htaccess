# above code explanation:
# line 1: We activate the Apache serverâ€™s runtime rewriting engine.
# line 2: Folder of codebase
#           RewriteBase /myproject/       # This is for localhost where your code is inside htdocs/project
#           RewriteBase /                 # This is for hosting, where your code is inside public_html directory or root directory  

# line 3: This rule checks if the requested URL is exactly "index.php" (anchored at the start and end of the string). 
#         If it is, the rewriting process is skipped (-) with the [L] flag, indicating that this is the last rule to be processed.
# line 4: This condition checks if the requested filename is not an existing file (!-f). 
#         If the condition is true (i.e., the file doesn't exist), the following rule will be applied.
# line 5: This condition checks if the requested filename is not an existing directory (!-d). 
#         If the condition is true (i.e., the directory doesn't exist), the following rule will be applied.
# line 6: This rule captures any requested URL and rewrites it to index.php?url= followed by the captured part of the original URL. 
#         The [QSA] flag appends existing query parameters, and the [L] flag indicates that this is the last rule to be processed. 

# NOTES: 
#       Define a constant variable BASE_URL for code efficiency
#       1. In development
#           define('BASE_URL', 'http://'.$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'].'/myproject/'); OR 
#           define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/myproject/'); 
#       2. In hosting
#           define('BASE_URL', 'http://'.$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'].'/myproject/'); OR 
#           define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/myproject/');
